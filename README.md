# Cancer Type Classification Based on RNA-seq Data Using Machine Learning

This report presents multiple machine learning approaches to classify cancer based on gene expression data obtained through RNA-seq. The gene expression data was used to train a machine learning model on a dataset consisting of various types of cancer. The results of this report suggest that machine learning can be an effective tool for classifying patients suffering from cancer by analyzing the gene expression matrix.

## Data_Base

We used the database on : [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq).

## Keywords: 
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, UMAP, ANN, XGBoost, SVM.
